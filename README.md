# E-Commerce Back-End

## Description
The goal of the E-Commerce Back-End is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code provided by the EdX Univeristy of Minnesota FullStack Coding Bootcamp.  The goal is to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. In addition, a walkthrough video is provided that demonstrates the functionality of the application.


## Specific Objectives
1. Create a functional Express.js API
2. Connect to a database using sequelize when the user adds their database name, their MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file (.envEXAMPLE is provided)
3. A development database is created and is seeded with test data when the user adds the schema and seed commands.
4. The user's server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database when the user enters the command to invoke the application.
5. The data for the categories, products, and tags routes are shown in formatted JSON when API GET routes are opened in Postman.
6. The user is able to successfully create, update, and delete data in their database when they test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Postman.

## Installation
1. Clone the project
2. Build your .env file from the .envEXAMPLE
3. Open a terminal in the project folder
4. Run npm install
5. Open mysql and create the table
6. Exit mysql and type "node seeds/" to seed the table
7. To start the server type "node server.js"
8. Open Postman and test the routes
